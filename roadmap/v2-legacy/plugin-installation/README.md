## Installing a Plugin

This example uses the postals plugin.

**If you have not already installed the** [**plugin framework**](../framework-installation.md)**, please do so before continuing.**

### 1. Download

Download the plugin from its repository. These are found under its plugin page, like [here](../available-plugins/postals.md) for the postals plugin.

### 3. Configure and Enable the Config

1. **Open** the `CHANGEMEconfig_postals.lua` file (name depends on the plugin) and configure as desired. The files are usually commented, and more details are on its [plugin page](../available-plugins/postals.md).&#x20;
2. **Enable** the plugin by changing the `enabled` variable from `false` to `true` in the plugin config.

2\. **Rename** and remove the `CHANGEME` from the file to`config_postals.lua` (depending on name of plugin).
