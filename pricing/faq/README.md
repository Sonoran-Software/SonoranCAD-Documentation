### How do I change what community my subscription is applied to?

At any time with an active subscription (including canceled subscriptions that are still active) you may change what community is benefiting from the subscription.

Simply change the [community ID](../../tutorials/getting-started/finding-your-community-id-and-authentication-code.md) on the active subscription to a new one.

### Are subscriptions a one-time payment, or monthly?

All of Sonoran CAD's subscriptions are monthly. You can [compare our plans](https://app.sonorancad.com/#/pricing) to see what works best for your community.\
\
Subscriptions are renewed one month after the start date. You will receive an email from Stripe a few days before you are charged again. This way, you aren't charged again without prior notice.

### Can I purchase a lifetime or yearly subscription?

Due to ongoing server hosting, development, maintenance, and customer support costs, we are unable to offer a lifetime subscription. All subscriptions are charged on a monthly recurring basis. We do not offer quarterly or yearly subscriptions.

### What payment methods are accepted?

We accept all major credit or debit cards through the in-app payment center. All payment processing is handled via Stripe.

### What happens if my subscription expires? Will I lose my data?

If your subscription expires, your CAD will automatically be downgraded to the free version. Your data will not be lost, but you will lose access to the additional customization or integration features that were included with your paid plan.

_Communities with no active logins for 30 days will be automatically removed._
