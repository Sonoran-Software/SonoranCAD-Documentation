# API Options for Adding and Modifying Records

## Available Endpoints

All endpoints for new and existing records and characters utilize these two common methods.

{% content-ref url="new-record.md" %}
[new-record.md](new-record.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="edit-record.md" %}
[edit-record.md](edit-record.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../civilian/new-character.md" %}
[new-character.md](../../civilian/new-character.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../civilian/edit-character.md" %}
[edit-character.md](../../civilian/edit-character.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Option 1 - Dictionary Values

The easiest way to create or modify a custom record via API is to supply a "dictionary" of key/value field pairs.

### 1. Getting the \`recordTypeId\`

For **adding a new record or character**, you will need to specify the `recordTypeId.`

The `recordTypeId` is a unique number for your custom record template. This is visible in the custom record JSON's `recordTypeId` field, or next to the template name in the admin menu.

### 2. Getting the \`recordId\`

For **modifying an existing record or character**, you will need to specify the `recordId`.

When viewing a record's JSON from a lookup endpoint, the record's `id` field is the unique ID for that filed record.

You can also view a record's ID in the UI with an `id` type custom field.

### 3. Creating the \`replaceValues\` Dictionary

The `replaceValues` dictionary specifies the field UID (unique ID) and the desired text value to input.

You can easily copy a template field's UID in the admin menu by expanding the section and copying the very last column in the editor. This is shown as the `Field Mapping ID` or `Field UID`.

#### **Example Dictionary**

```json
"replaceValues": {
    "first": "Brian", // Set field with UID of 'first' to 'Brian'
    "_qkz7j5fxy": "Some Value" // Set field with UID of '_qkz7j5fxy' to 'Some Value'
}
```

## Option 2 - Raw JSON

The more complicated but complete way to add or modify custom records via API is supplying the full, raw JSON structure of the record.

Custom records require a strict format with several dozen different data fields. Due to the complexity, it is highly recommended to create a new custom record template in the CAD UI, and then [retrieve the record template](get-record-template.md) for adding new records.

Or, view a detailed explanation of [custom record formatting](./#record-formatting).&#x20;
