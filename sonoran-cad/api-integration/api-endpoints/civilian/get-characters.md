            "account": "000-000-000" // (OPTION 2) Sonoran Account UUID
        },
    ]
}
```

#### Result Ordering

The current/most recently selected character the user has set in the CAD will always be the first record in the list returned by this endpoint (index 0).

#### Record Formatting

Custom records require a strict format with several dozen different data fields. You can view a detailed explanation of [custom record formatting](../general/custom-records/#record-formatting).

#### Lookup via Account

Communities can optionally lookup via a user's Sonoran account UUID, by using the `account` value. This value is internal, and not exposed to on the UI. The [verify\_secret ](../general/verify-secret.md)or [get\_account ](../general/get-account.md)endpoints will allow communities to capture the account UUID programmatically.
