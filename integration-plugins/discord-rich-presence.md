# Discord Rich Presence

{% hint style="info" %}
Rich presence is included with all versions of Sonoran CAD, but customization requires the **Standard** plan or higher, and the **Pro** plan for complete customization with the icon.\
For more information, see our [pricing](../pricing/faq/) or view how to check your community [limits](../tutorials/getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

## What is Discord Rich Presence?

When running our [desktop application](../download/), Discord can automatically detect and display information about your community.

### Customizing Buttons

Discord presence currently allows for two customizable buttons.

Navigate to Admin > Customization > Customization > Discord Rich Presence

#### For communities on the **Standard** plan or higher:

\- Button #2 may be customized to any [Sonoran CAD](../tutorials/customization/custom-login-page.md#in-game-tablet) or [Sonoran CMS](https://info.sonorancms.com/why-choose-sonoran-cms/why-choose-sonoran-cms) invitation link.\
\- Ex: `https://sonorancad.com/#/?comid=mycommunityid` or `https://sonorancms.com/#/?comid=mycommunityid`

#### For communities on the Pro plan:

\- Both buttons may be customized to any URL desired.\
\- The Icon and title can also be customized with a Discord developer application.

### Customizing the Icon

Communities on the **Pro** version may customize the rich presence icon:

#### 1. Create a new Discord Application

On [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) create a new application

#### 2. Copy your Client ID

Under OAuth2, copy your `Client ID`&#x20;

#### 3. Add an Icon

Next, upload an icon for your new application. Be sure to copy down the name of the icon for later.

#### 4. Configure in Sonoran CAD

Back in the admin customization menu, we can paste the Discord application's Client ID and Icon name.

Once saved, your Discord presence for all community members will reflect your custom icon, title, and buttons.

## Known Issues

#### My presence visible, but not to others?

If your Discord presence is visible to you personally but not to others, ensure the button labels don't include any sort of `:emoji:` in them.
