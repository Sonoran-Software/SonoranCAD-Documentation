## Installation Guide

### 1. Download and Install the Core

If you haven't already, be sure to install and configure the [SonoranCAD Core](../) first.

### 2. Activate the Submodule and all Dependencies

Follow the [submodule activation guide](../submodule-configuration/#activating-a-submodule) for the required submodules.

### 3. Configure your TeamSpeak Connection

Your TeamSpeak server credentials can either be set in the config or as [convars](teamspeak-3.md#advanced-configuration) in your `server.cfg` file. In the `ts3integration_config.json` file, you can modify the following settings:

|                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### 4. Retrieve Your Individual TS3 ID

Every member from your community will need to retrieve their unique TS3 ID.\
This is found in TS under Tools > Identities > Default > Unique ID

![TS3 - Retrieve your unique ID](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (310).png>)

### 5. Add your TS3 ID as an API ID

Paste in this TS3 unique ID as a [new API ID in the CAD](../../../../sonoran-cad/api-integration/getting-started/setting-your-api-id.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Every member of your community will need to add their unique ID to their CAD account in your community.
{% endhint %}

### 6. Utilize the TS3 Integration

Once configured, when the user joins the TS3 server they will be granted the `onduty_servergroup` once they sign into the police, fire, EMS, or dispatch page.

Signing out of or exiting the CAD will result in the user being kicked from any of the `enforced_channels` from the config.

## Advanced Configuration

You may utilize [convars](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-reference/convars/) in your `server.cfg` if you wish to store your TS3 connection info there instead. There is no default version of these convars preset. If you wish to use convars in your `server.cfg` instead of your config file please **LEAVE ts3server\_user BLANK** in your config file. Convars are as follows:

| Convar Name               | Config Equivelant  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `sonorants3_server_host`  | `ts3server_host`   |
| `sonorants3_server_port`  | `ts3server_port`   |
| `sonorants3_server_qport` | `ts3server_qport`  |
| `sonorants3_server_user`  | `ts3server_user`   |
| `sonorants3_server_pass`  | `ts3server_pass`   |

They can be set in your `server.cfg` following the format of `set [convar] "value"`
