## Installation Guide

### 1. Download and Install the Core

If you haven't already, be sure to install and configure the [SonoranCAD Core](../) first.

### 2. Activate the Submodule and all Dependencies

Follow the [submodule activation guide](../submodule-configuration/#activating-a-submodule) for the required submodules.

### 3. Set Your API ID

This plugin kicks user accounts from the CAD based upon their [API ID](../../../../sonoran-cad/api-integration/getting-started/setting-your-api-id.md). Be sure your members have this set properly to properly link your in-game user to the CAD.
