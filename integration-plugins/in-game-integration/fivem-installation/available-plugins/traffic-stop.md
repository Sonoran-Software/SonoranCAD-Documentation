## Installation Video

Click to view our [traffic stop installation guide](https://youtu.be/QmI7Wst2ytY).

**Be sure you have already installed our** [**plugin framework**](../../../../roadmap/v2-legacy/framework-installation.md)**!**

## Installation Guide

### 1. Download and Install the Core

If you haven't already, be sure to install and configure the [SonoranCAD Core](../) first.

### 2. Activate the Submodule and all Dependencies

Follow the [submodule activation guide](../submodule-configuration/#activating-a-submodule) for the required submodules.

### 3. Configuration

| Option   | Description                       | Default         |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| enablets | Enables the plugin.               | True            |
| origin   | Origin of the new call.           | 2 (OBSERVED)    |
| status   | Status of the new call            | 1 (ACTIVE)      |
| priority | Priority of the new call          | 1               |
| title    | Title of the call when created.   | Traffic Stop    |
| code     | The 10-code for the traffic stop. | 10-11 - Traffic |

### 4. Enable User Permissions

The default command ships with [ACE permission checks](https://forum.cfx.re/t/basic-aces-principals-overview-guide/90917) enabled. **You will need to allow `command.ts` for who you want to use this command.**

**Example**

`add_ace builtin.everyone command.ts allow`

This line in your `config.cfg` file will allow everyone to access the command. We highly reccomend creating [proper ace permission groups](https://forum.cfx.re/t/basic-aces-principals-overview-guide/90917) to prevent users from spamming.

### 5. Set Your API ID

Don't forget to set your account [API ID](../../../../sonoran-cad/api-integration/getting-started/setting-your-api-id.md) to properly link your in-game user to the CAD.

## Usage
