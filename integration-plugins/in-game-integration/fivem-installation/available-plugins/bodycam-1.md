## What is Emergency Response Simulator?

Emergency Response Simulator is a paid, third-party script for FiveM.

This advanced (co-op) PVE roleplay game mode simulates emergency service calls, where you as emergency service worker have to respond to. Whether you are a medic, firefighter, tow service operator or police officer, there is always something to do. With finetuned callouts youâ€™ll never get bored of driving around in your service vehicle. Rush to high-priority, dangerous calls, or handle routine tasks like warning a speeder. Each callout is unique, with random outcomes that keep you curious and engaged every time you respond to an emergency.

[ERS can be purchased from Nights Software.](https://store.nights-software.com/category/ersgamemode)
