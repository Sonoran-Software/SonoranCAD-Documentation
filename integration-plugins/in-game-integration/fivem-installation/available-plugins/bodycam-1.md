## What is the Record Printer?

Sonoran CADâ€™s Record Printer seamlessly bridges CAD records and the in-game world, allowing officers to generate and view official documents directly through an interactive, in-game printer object.\
This system supports real-time data transmission from CAD records to in-game devices, with customizable formatting, automatic pagination, and secure access controls.\

## In-Game Usage

### Sending Files From SonoranCAD

When in-game, units must also be actively signed into the dispatch, police, fire, or EMS panel.

Using the records section in CAD, navigate to the record you would like to print, click the "down arrow" next to the blue "PDF" button and press "Print In-Game"

### Printing In-Game

Once you send the file from SonoranCAD, you should see a message in-game stating "You have a new record to print. Use `/printqueue` to view queue.

Upon running the command you will see the file in your queue as well as the number identifier next to the file name. You can print this file by using the command `/print <PRINT QUEUE INDEX>` near a printer or inside a configured vehicle. Upon printing the PDF viewer will then show on your in-game screen
