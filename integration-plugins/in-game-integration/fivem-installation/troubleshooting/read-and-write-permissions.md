## Sonoran CAD FiveM - Fix file permission issues

If the `sonorancad` resource cannot create, rename, or update files, you may see startup issues like:

* `Failed to create target file`
* `Failed to rename ..._config.dist.lua to ..._config.lua`
* `Unable to open config backup file`
* Changes not saving after updates or restarts

These usually mean your host has marked the resource files as read-only, or the server process does not have permission to write to them.

## Host Restrictions

Some game panel hosts (Ex: ZAP Hosting) do not allow FiveM resources to programmatically modify other files. This blocks the Sonoran CAD resource from updating itself. In this case, you must disable automatic updates and manually install updated versions of the resource as they release.

To disable automatic updates navigate to your config file:

`[sonorancad]/sonorancad/configuration/config.json` and change `allowAutoUpdate` from `true` to `false`.

Looking for a server host? Learn more about our [one-click installation here](https://docs.sonoransoftware.com/promotions/fivem-hosting).

## Step 1: Open your game panel

Log into the panel where your FiveM server is hosted, such as `txAdmin`, `Pterodactyl`, `ZAP-Hosting`, `Gamepanel`, or your VPS file manager.

## Step 2: Locate the Sonoran CAD resource

Check the main Sonoran CAD resource folder and configuration folder:

```
resources/[sonorancad]/sonorancad/
resources/[sonorancad]/sonorancad/configuration/
```

Pay special attention to:

```
resources/[sonorancad]/sonorancad/configuration/config.json
resources/[sonorancad]/sonorancad/configuration/*_config.lua
```

## Linux Hosts (Game Panels)

<details>

<summary>Linux Hosts</summary>

### 1. Locate the resource files

Open your host panel or file manager and navigate to:

```
resources/[sonorancad]
```

### 2. Fix file permissions

Navigate to the specific file mentioned in the error code and update the permissions.

Recommended file permissions:

* `766`
* If that fails, try `666`

If your panel supports permission changes:

1. Right-click the `configuration` folder or affected file
2. Select **Permissions**
3. Apply the updated permissions

[If your host does not allow permission changes](read-and-write-permissions.md#host-restrictions), contact the hosting provider and ask them to make the Sonoran CAD resource writable.

## Quick permission reference

Each permission digit is the sum of:

* `4` = read
* `2` = write
* `1` = execute

Common values:

* `4` = read only
* `6` = read + write
* `7` = read + write + execute

</details>

## Windows Hosts

<details>

<summary>Windows</summary>

### 1. Open the file or folder properties

Start with the `configuration` folder. If needed, also check the full `sonorancad` folder.

```
resources\[sonorancad]\sonorancad\configuration\
```

1. Right-click the folder or affected file
2. Click **Properties**

### 2. Allow read and write access

Under the **General** tab:

1. Uncheck **Read-only**
2. Click **Apply**
3. Choose to apply changes to this folder, subfolders, and files if prompted
4. Click **OK**

If you only changed a single file and the issue comes back, repeat the process on the entire `sonorancad` folder.

</details>

## Final step: restart the resource

After updating permissions, restart the Sonoran CAD resource or your full server:

```
exec @sonorancad/sonorancad.cfg
```

If the issue continues, verify the files are named correctly and were not saved with extra extensions such as `config.json.json`.
