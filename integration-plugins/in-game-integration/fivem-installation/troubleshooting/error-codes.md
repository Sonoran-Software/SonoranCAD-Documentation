# Error Codes

## Error and Warning Codes

SonoranCAD FiveM uses structured `ERR-XX-###` and `WRN-XX-###` codes that point back to this document.

You can link directly to any code by appending it as a fragment identifier. Example: `sonorancad.com/error/WRN-CORE-001`

Warnings use a `WRN-*` prefix. Errors use an `ERR-*` prefix. Some warning-level log paths still intentionally reference `ERR-*` codes when the condition represents a real support issue even if the integration can keep running.

### Core Errors

#### ERR-CORE-001

**Key:** `STEAM_ERROR`

**What it means:** SonoranCAD is configured to use Steam identifiers, but the FXServer Steam Web API key is missing.

**How to fix it:** Set `steam_webapiKey` in your server configuration or switch `primaryIdentifier` away from `steam`.

#### ERR-CORE-002

**Key:** `PORT_MISSING_ERROR`

**What it means:** The configured CAD server entry could not be found for the active `serverId`.

**How to fix it:** Verify the `serverId` in `config.json` or your convars and confirm that the same server exists in the CAD server list.

#### ERR-CORE-003

**Key:** `PORT_CONFIG_ERROR`

**What it means:** The game server port does not match the port configured in CAD.

**How to fix it:** Align the FXServer `netPort` with the CAD server entry, or allow the integration to auto-correct the CAD entry.

#### ERR-CORE-004

**Key:** `MAP_CONFIG_ERROR`

**What it means:** The live map port configured in CAD does not match the server configuration.

**How to fix it:** Update the CAD map or listener port for the affected `serverId` so it matches the actual server port.

#### ERR-CORE-005

**Key:** `PORT_OUTBOUND_ERROR`

**What it means:** The detected outbound IP does not match the configured CAD IP.

**How to fix it:** Update the CAD server IP or outbound IP settings so they match the actual public IP used by the server.

#### ERR-CORE-006

**Key:** `PORT_OUTBOUND_MISMATCH`

**What it means:** SonoranCAD detected an IP mismatch between runtime networking and CAD configuration.

**What it means:** The integration could not retrieve version information from the CAD API.

**How to fix it:** Check the API key, community ID, outbound connectivity, and SonoranCAD API status, then restart the resource.

#### ERR-CORE-010

**Key:** `ERROR_ABORT`

**What it means:** Startup was aborted because one or more critical errors were encountered.

**How to fix it:** Review the earlier `ERR-*` entries in the console or log output, correct the first critical failure, and restart the resource.

**What it means:** The configured client-side postal file was missing or invalid.

**How to fix it:** Restore the referenced postal file, validate its JSON, and confirm the configured filename is correct.

### Record Printer Errors

#### ERR-RP-101

**Key:** `RECORDPRINTER_UNIT_MISSING`

**What it means:** Record printer could not resolve the player to an active CAD unit.

**How to fix it:** Ensure the player is logged into CAD and present in the unit cache before printing.

#### ERR-RP-102

**Key:** `RECORDPRINTER_DIRECTORY_FAILED`

**What it means:** Record printer could not create or resolve its output directory.

**How to fix it:** Check write permissions and folder creation behavior for the record printer output path.

#### ERR-RP-103

**Key:** `RECORDPRINTER_SAVE_FAILED`

**What it means:** Record printer failed to save the generated PDF.

**How to fix it:** Verify write permissions, available disk space, and that the generated PDF data is valid.

#### ERR-RP-104

**Key:** `RECORDPRINTER_SHARE_INVALID`

**What it means:** Record printer rejected a share request because the URL or target list was invalid.

**How to fix it:** Validate the shared URL and ensure at least one valid target player or identifier is supplied.

### Sonrad Errors

#### ERR-SR-101

**Key:** `SONRAD_CALLCOMMANDS_MISSING`

**What it means:** Sonrad attempted an action that depends on the `callcommands` submodule.

**How to fix it:** Enable or start the `callcommands` submodule before using Sonrad panic or call features.

#### ERR-SR-102

**Key:** `SONRAD_CONFIG_MISSING`

**What it means:** Critical Sonrad configuration values are missing.

**How to fix it:** Update `sonrad_config.lua` from the latest template and fill in the missing required values.

### Kick Module Errors

#### ERR-KICK-101

**Key:** `KICK_QUEUE_UNAVAILABLE`

**What it means:** The kick module could not queue a CAD logout or kick for the player.

**How to fix it:** Ensure the player is linked and currently represented by an active unit before the kick action runs.

### Warning Codes

#### WRN-CORE-001

**Key:** `INVALID_API_MODE`

**What it means:** The configured SonoranCAD API mode was invalid, so the resource fell back to production mode.

**How to fix it:** Set `mode` to a supported value such as `production` or `development`.

#### WRN-CORE-002

**Key:** `DEPRECATED_DEBUGPRINT`

**What it means:** Deprecated logging helper `debugPrint` was used somewhere in the runtime path.

**How to fix it:** Replace `debugPrint(...)` calls with `debugLog(...)` in custom integrations or older submodule code.

#### WRN-CORE-003

**Key:** `JSON_DECODE_FAILED`

**What it means:** SonoranCAD failed to decode a JSON string and continued with a default or empty value.

**How to fix it:** Validate the JSON source that triggered the warning and correct malformed payload or file contents.

#### WRN-CORE-004

**Key:** `JSON_ENCODE_FAILED`

**What it means:** SonoranCAD failed to encode a Lua value into JSON and continued with a fallback value.

**How to fix it:** Check the table being encoded for unsupported values such as functions, userdata, or recursive structures.

#### WRN-CORE-005

**Key:** `APIKEY_CONVAR_UNINITIALIZED`

**What it means:** SonoranCAD started before the bundled convar setup from `sonorancad.cfg` initialized the API key path.

**How to fix it:** Use `exec sonorancad.cfg` and make sure it runs before `ensure sonorancad`.

#### WRN-CORE-006

**Key:** `OLD_FXSERVER_VERSION`

**What it means:** The running FXServer build is older than the version this SonoranCAD release was tested against.

**How to fix it:** Update FXServer to the tested version or newer before troubleshooting feature regressions.

#### WRN-CAD-101

**Key:** `PLAYER_IDENTIFIER_MISSING`

**What it means:** A player connected without the configured primary identifier, so some CAD features may not work for that player.

**How to fix it:** Ensure the configured identifier type is actually available on your server and that the player is connecting through the expected identity provider.

#### WRN-WS-101

**Key:** `LEGACY_HTTP_PUSH_EVENT`

**What it means:** SonoranCAD received a legacy HTTP push event on `/event` while WebSocket push delivery is preferred.

**How to fix it:** Review your CAD or server push-event configuration and move the server onto the API WebSocket push path where available.

#### WRN-CORE-900

**Key:** `UNHANDLED_WARNING`

**What it means:** A warning was logged without a more specific registered warning code, so it was normalized into the generic warning bucket.

**How to fix it:** Use the support reference and warning text in the logs to identify the exact caller, then register a dedicated warning code if the condition needs clearer support guidance.
