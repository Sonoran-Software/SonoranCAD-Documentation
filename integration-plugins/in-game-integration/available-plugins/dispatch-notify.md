# Dispatch Notify

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/dispatch_notify_promo.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This submodule:

* Notifies officers of incoming calls
* [Allows officers to attach to calls via command](dispatch-notify.md#2-officer-attaches-to-the-call)
* Automatically routes attached units to the postal code
* Unit GPS routing is updated whenever the dispatch postal is updated
* [Allows the call postal and GPS routing to be automatically updated to the primary unit's location](dispatch-notify.md#primary-unit-tracking-pursuit)
* Notifies the civilian making the emergency call when an officer is en-route.

## Activation Guide

### 1. Download and Install the Resource

{% hint style="info" %}
This submodule is already **enabled by default** when installing the [Sonoran CAD FiveM resource](../fivem-installation.md).

\
The [locations submodule](locations.md) includes required logic to send location data and is **already enabled by default**. Keep this submodule enabled to maintain functionality.

\
The [call commands submodule](call-commands.md) includes required logic to create emergency calls and is **already enabled by default**. Keep this submodule enabled to maintain functionality.

\
The [postals submodule](postals.md) is optional and also enabled by default. Keep this submodule enabled if you wish to include postal code information with emergency calls.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Adjust the Configuration

The CAD display settings are stored inside of the `/configuration/dispatchnotify_config.lua` file.

### 3. Ensure Players are Linked

Ensure the players have already [linked their CAD](../link-user-in-game.md) for this integration to work.

### Configuration

Review the `dispatchnotify_config.lua` file to configure the submodule to behave how you like. The file is well documented. Please review **all** the settings!

## Commands

In-game commands can be used to

* `/dn respond [id`] Respond/Attach to the newly created dispatch call ID
* `/dn notify [on/off/auto]` - Toggle chat alerts on, off, or auto (using the configuration file's default)
* `/dn note [text]` Add a note to the current dispatch call
* `/dn plate` Adds your currently locked license plate number as a note from the [Wraith ALPR](wraithv2.md) submodule
* `/dn gps` Toggles on/off automatic GPS routing to the call's postal code

## Dispatch Call Responding

### 1. Civilian Places a 911 Call

This call can be placed from the Civilian menu of the CAD, or via the `/911` command in-game, supplied by the [callcommands](call-commands.md) submodule.

### 2. Officer Attaches to the Call

The unit will see a notification message of the incoming call, complete with the command to run in order to attach.

## Primary Unit Tracking (Pursuit)

Dispatch notify can also be used to track the primary unit on a call. This will automatically update the postal code on the dispatch call to the primary unit's current location. This is highly useful for pursuits, where additional units need to catch up and join the chase.

### 1. Toggle Unit Tracking for the Primary Unit

Dispatchers (or self-dispatch) can set the primary unit to any unit currently attached to the call. The slider next to the Primary Unit box will toggle tracking mode. When enabled, the postal will automatically update based on the primary unit's location and be sent to all attached units.

## Troubleshooting

* No notifications for 911 calls
  * Units must be logged into the CAD (by default) or meeting the requirements depending on how the submodule is configured.
  * If using pNotify notifications, ensure that resource is running.
* Units do not automatically attach to calls
  * Ensure the players have already [linked their CAD](../link-user-in-game.md) for this integration to work.
* Caller is not notified when units attach to the call
  * If the caller ever leaves the server and rejoins, this feature does not work.
  * If dispatch created the call within the CAD, there is no way to notify a caller.
  * Ensure you are not overriding the 911 command (default `/911`) with another resource.
