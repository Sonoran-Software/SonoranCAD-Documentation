# Troubleshooting

## Other player locations are updating, but mine is not.

Ensure you have entered in your API ID correctly from ER:LC into the CAD. **You must copy and paste it exactly**, or it will not work.

Sometimes, certain characters can look exactly the same based on the font, but they're different. This can happen when you are not directly copying and pasting.

Example:

* The `l` as in Lima in `ZvIuD` actually needs to be a capital `I` as in Indigo.
