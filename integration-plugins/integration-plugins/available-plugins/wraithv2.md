### 5. Custom Record Handling

If you wish to have the plugin alert when the vehicle is not registered, is marked as stolen, etc. you will need to ensure you have set the custom record field's UID in your config.

#### Find your custom record field's UID

In the CAD navigate to `Admin` > `Customization` > `Custom Records` > select your custom `Vehicle Registration` record.

The very last column of the field containing your status and expiration dates will have the `Field Mapping ID`.

#### Set the UID in your Config

By default, the `statusUid` is `status` and `expiresUid` is `expiration` for the default record. If you have customized these, you will need to update the UID in your config.

#### Set Statuses to be Flagged

The `flagOnStatuses` array contains a list of values that will result in a flag being displayed on the radar popup if they're found in the corresponding `statusUid` field.

Ex: `flagOnStatuses = {"STOLEN", "EXPIRED", "PENDING", "SUSPENDED"}`

### 6. Set Your API ID

In order to have locked plate results sent back to your CAD, don't forget to set your account [API ID](../../../sonoran-cad/api-integration/getting-started/setting-your-api-id.md).

## Usage

For more information on using the in-game UI, please view the [Wraith ARS 2X](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-wraith-ars-2x-police-radar-and-plate-reader-v1-2-4/1058277) release information.\
**Results are sent directly to your CAD when a license plate is locked.**

## Troubleshooting

### AI Cars are Spamming the Reader

The framework ships with the `wk_wars2x` plate reader included. This will have the `config.use_sonorancad` set to `true`. When enabled, the plate reader will not run a lookup on any AI vehicle.

### Vehicles Aren't Being Flagged

#### Status

Keep in mind that AI vehicles won't display or be ran unless there's a vehicle registration record added to the CAD with that plate.

Ensure that you've correctly followed [step 5](wraithv2.md#5.-custom-record-handling) and the `statusUid` and `expirationUid` fields have been set correctly, both in the CAD record template and the plugin config.

Ensure that the `flagOnStatuses` array has the exact string/text values that match the options in your custom record template.&#x20;

#### BOLO and Warrant

Ensure that your custom BOLO and Warrant records have a field with the `type` set to `status`. Otherwise, there's no way to determine if the BOLO/Warrant is active, closed, etc. The plate reader will warn of any active BOLO or Warrant records with the vehicle plate attached _and_ the `status` type field set to active/open.
