### 5. Retrieve Your Individual TS3 ID

Every member from your community will need to retrieve their unique TS3 ID.\
This is found in TS under Tools > Identities > Default > Unique ID

![TS3 - Retrieve your unique ID](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (141).png>)

### 6. Add your TS3 ID as an API ID

Paste in this TS3 unique ID as a [new API ID in the CAD](../../../sonoran-cad/api-integration/getting-started/setting-your-api-id.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Every member of your community will need to add their unique ID to their CAD account in your community.
{% endhint %}

### 7. Utilize the TS3 Integration

Once configured, when the user joins the TS3 server they will be granted the `onduty_servergroup` once they sign into the police, fire, EMS, or dispatch page.

Signing out of or exiting the CAD will result in the user being kicked from any of the `enforced_channels` from the config.
