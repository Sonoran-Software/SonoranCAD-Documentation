### 4. Configuration

| Option   | Description                       | Default         |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| enablets | Enables the plugin.               | True            |
| origin   | Origin of the new call.           | 2 (OBSERVED)    |
| status   | Status of the new call            | 1 (ACTIVE)      |

### 5. Enable User Permissions

The default command ships with [ACE permission checks](https://forum.cfx.re/t/basic-aces-principals-overview-guide/90917) enabled. **You will need to allow `command.ts` for who you want to use this command.**

**Example**

`add_ace builtin.everyone command.ts allow`

This line in your `config.cfg` file will allow everyone to access the command. We highly reccomend creating [proper ace permission groups](https://forum.cfx.re/t/basic-aces-principals-overview-guide/90917) to prevent users from spamming.

### **6**. Set Your API ID

Don't forget to set your account [API ID](../../../sonoran-cad/api-integration/getting-started/setting-your-api-id.md) to properly link your in-game user to the CAD.
