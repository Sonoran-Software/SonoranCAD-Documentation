If you haven't already, [check out our page for more information on this promotion](../../pricing/faq/bundle-discount-sonoran-servers.md).

## 1. Locate your Installed Plugins

Every plugin installed will have a separate folder. These are located in the `\sonorancad\plugins` directory.

## 2. View and Change Configuration Files

For every Sonoran CAD plugin installed, there will be a `config_{pluginName}.lua` file present.

![Sonoran CAD - Plugin Config File](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (141).png>)

You can open these configuration files with a text editor and change values.

For more information on a plugin's configuration options, you can view the individual plugin guides on the [Available Plugins](available-plugins/) page and scroll down to the configuration section.

If you modify a configuration file, be sure to save it and `restart sonorancad` in your server console, or restart the server.
