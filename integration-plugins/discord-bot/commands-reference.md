# Commands Reference

{% hint style="warning" %}
All commands are done via the **slash command** feature.

SonoranBot will not respond to mentions or message-based commands.

By default, only server administrators (those with Administrator in the guild) can execute any of the below commands. You must use [Discord's permissions setting feature](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots) to give users access.
