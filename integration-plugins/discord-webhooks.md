### 6. Configure the Sonoran CAD Webhook

{% hint style="warning" %}
New webhooks are created as "discord.com". If you are having problems please change the URLs of the old webhooks from "discordapp.com" to "discord.com" so they will function.
{% endhint %}

In the Sonoran CAD Admin panel, select “Advanced > Discord Integration”\
Paste your Webhook URL in the desired webhook configuration box.\
Toggle the desired notification events for the specific webhook. Press the “Save Configuration” button.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note:_ Some webhooks allow you to customize the notification settings even further. For example, you can specify to only receive a webhook when a police record is added, edited or removed.
{% endhint %}

### 7. Footer Metadata

{% hint style="danger" %}
As of Sonoran Bot v2, the ability to react to webhooks to create actions has been depreciated.

Footer metadata is still available to all communities.

[Submit a suggestion](https://support.sonoransoftware.com) to see this reimplemented!
{% endhint %}

### Footer Metadata

Webhook footers contain metadata that can be pulled from a bot for further integration.\
These follow the format: `USERNAME or UUID` | `TYPE` | `ID`
