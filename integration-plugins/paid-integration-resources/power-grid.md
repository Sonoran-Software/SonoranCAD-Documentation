# Power Grid

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JhmcqlOWv8&t=1s" %}

Sonoran's Power Grid network allows players to manipulate and disable nearly any in-game feature imaginable!

Hack the grid to disable a Sonoran Radio tower, disable a speed or security camera, shut off a shot spotter, and more! Our in-depth permission customization and integration options allow communities to expand with vastly new and unique RP scenarios. Easily "wire" a power source to any compatible object with our link tool. Our power grid offers real-time alerts via Discord, in-game, on the Sonoran CAD live map and more!
