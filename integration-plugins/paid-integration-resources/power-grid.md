# Power Grid

![Sonoran - Power Grid](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (280).png>)

Sonoran's Power Grid network allows players to manipulate and disable nearly any in-game feature imaginable!

Hack the grid to disable a Sonoran Radio tower, disable a speed or security camera, shut off a shot spotter, and more! Our in-depth permission customization and integration options allow communities to expand with vastly new and unique RP scenarios. Easily "wire" a power source to any compatible object with our link tool. Our power grid offers real-time alerts via Discord, in-game, on the Sonoran CAD live map and more!
