# Discord Bot Integration

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to system limitations, the Discord bot cannot be used with the free version of Sonoran CAD.\


For the [Permissions Synchronization](../features/permissions-synchronization.md) feature you will need the **Plus** version of Sonoran CAD to function. Or free with [Sonoran CMS](https://info.sonorancms.com/integration-capabilities/sonoran-cad-sync)! For more information, see our [pricing](../pricing/faq/) or view how to check your community [limits](../tutorials/getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
