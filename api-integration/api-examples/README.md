{% hint style="info" %}

## Framework Use

The [Sonoran CAD plugin framework](/broken/pages/-M7AprAqKWbNHL1L7N0T) handles common errors, rate limiting, auto-updating, etc.&#x20;

When integrating external scripts with Sonoran CAD, the best practice is utilizing the CAD framework exports. By using the framework exports users will not have to add or configure their community ID and API key a second time, the framework will ensure proper rate limits, etc.

## Framework Endpoint Examples
