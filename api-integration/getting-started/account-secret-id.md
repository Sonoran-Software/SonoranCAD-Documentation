# Account Secret ID

{% hint style="info" %}
Account Secret IDs are community-specific. You will have a different secret for each community you join.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Never give your Secret ID to anyone who is not Sonoran Staff or an application approved by Sonoran, such as SonoranBot.
{% endhint %}

### Retrieving your Account Secret ID

Your ID is located on the same page as your API ID, as shown below.

You can copy this ID for use in our [bot's permission sync process](broken-reference), or for future purposes. At any time, you can click the refresh button to regenerate the secret ID. If you regenerate this key, you will need to change it on all services that use it!
