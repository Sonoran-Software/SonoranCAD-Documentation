# Integration API ID

{% hint style="info" %}
API IDs are set individually per community. Your API IDs set in one community will not transfer over to another.
{% endhint %}

## GTA RP - Setting API ID with CAD Tablet

4. Click the red banner's "retry" button and the page will refresh.
5. Your API ID should now be set for that CAD community.

### 2. Paste in your API ID and Press Save

When inputting your API ID, it is important to note that it is **case-sensitive**. Make sure you are putting in the **proper upper and lower case letters**!

#### 1. Determine what API ID is Used

Some communities may use an API ID from in-game. This could be your Steam hex, game license key, etc. Other communities may use your Discord identifier.

If you're not sure, ask an administrator from your community.

#### 2. Retrieving an API ID from In-Game

Assuming your community has the [API ID plugin](broken-reference) installed, enter `/apiid` in-game. This will display a chat message with your API ID.

#### 3. Retrieve your API ID from Discord

If your community uses Discord as the API ID identifier, we highly recommend using the `/myid` command with our [Discord bot](../../integration-plugins/discord-bot-integration.md).
