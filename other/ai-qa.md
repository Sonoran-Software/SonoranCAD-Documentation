## How many apples are on an apple tree?
The number of apples on an apple tree can vary greatly depending on factors such as the tree's age, size, health, variety, and environmental conditions. A young, small tree might have only a few dozen apples, while a mature, well-established tree could produce hundreds or even thousands of apples. The average apple tree typically begins to bear fruit between 3 to 5 years after planting, and production continues to increase as the tree matures. However, it's important to note that apple production can fluctuate year to year due to factors like weather and pollination.
