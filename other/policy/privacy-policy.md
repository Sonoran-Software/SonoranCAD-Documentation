### **2. Information We Collect**

a. **Personal Information**: When you register for an account, we collect your email address to identify your account.

### **4. How We Share Your Information**

We do not share or sell your personal information with third parties except as described in this policy. We may share your information with:

* **Service Providers**: We engage service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing (Stripe).
* **Law Enforcement and Legal Obligations**: We may disclose information to law enforcement, government authorities, or other third parties as necessary to comply with legal obligations or to protect our rights, the rights of others, or our property.
* **Account Security and Integrity**: While we do not disclose actual hardware IDs, IP addresses, or other specific identifiers to third parties, we provide the functionality for users to see if certain aspects of another userâ€™s account match with alternate accounts based on collected data. This is part of our effort to maintain the security and integrity of our services, and [prevent fraudulent or deceptive practices](https://sonoran.link/oWGfTkf7). Actual identifiers are not shared externally.

### **5. Your Data Rights**

You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information. You can do so at any time by contacting our support team at [support.sonoransoftware.com](https://support.sonoransoftware.com).

### **6. Children's Privacy**

Our services are not directed to children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at [support.sonoransoftware.com](https://support.sonoransoftware.com). If we become aware that we have collected personal data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
