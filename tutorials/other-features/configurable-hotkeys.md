# Configurable Hotkeys

{% hint style="warning" %}
Configurable hotkeys are not included with the free version.\
For more information, see our [pricing](../../pricing/faq/) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Hotkeys are enabled **globally** on the [Desktop ](../../download/)application. This means users do not have to have the app or page in focus or visible for the hotkeys to be registered.

For desktop users, we **highly recommend** viewing our [guide on in-game use](../../download/steam-browser-workaround.md)!
{% endhint %}

### Configure your Hotkeys

In the side menu, open the "Settings" modal to display your hotkey configuration menu.\
Here, you can configure your prefix and hotkey buttons using the drop-downs below.

Once changed, your settings are automatically applied and saved.
