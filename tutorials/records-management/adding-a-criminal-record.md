### Select The Record Type

A dropdown menu will appear, where users can select the new record type.

Records are comprised of several sections:

1. [Record Flags](../customization/custom-record-flag-types.md)
2. Agency/Department Information
3. Civilian Information
4. Vehicle Information
5. Charges
6. Narrative
7. Status

Civilian and vehicle information sections also include a search feature. Here, you can search and import information from a registered civilian or vehicle. This feature can also [search for civilians and vehicles directly from your in-game database](../in-game-integration/database-sync-and-merge/).
