## What is Rapid IQ?

**Rapid IQ** is an emergency call intake system that helps dispatchers ask the right questions during medical calls. It guides them step-by-step through a structured flow based on the caller’s answers, making sure important details aren’t missed.

Rapid IQ combines these responses into the dispatch call description, giving the best possible information to responding units.
