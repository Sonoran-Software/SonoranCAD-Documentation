### Call Attachment: Auto Status

Automatically change the status of a unit when they're attached and detached to a call, or when their call is closed.

### Unit Status: Timers

Automatically start a countdown/up [timer](timers.md) when a unit status is changed. This can be helpful to quickly see how long a unit has been at a particular status, or to be notified once a unit status has been set for too long.
