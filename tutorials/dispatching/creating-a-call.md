# Creating a Call

## Creating a Call

<details>

<summary>Add Available Units</summary>

#### Manually Add Unit

To add a unit to your call editor, click on an available unit or unit group, and select "Add to Call"

![Sonoran CAD - Add Unit to Call](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (134).png>)

#### Attach Nearest Units

When emergency calls are sent from in-game, they contain a coordinate location. Importing the emergency call from the table or live map will display an option to select and attach the closest units.

Entering a postal code will work as a secondary option to find the nearest units. You must have the [postals submodule](../../integration-plugins/in-game-integration/fivem-installation/available-plugins/postals.md) enabled.

#### Drag-and-Drop

Drag-and-drop is another fast way to add a unit to an existing call:

You can also easily detach units from an existing call, or drag a unit from one call to another:

<summary>Merge Additional Emergency Call</summary>

Often times civilians will continue to make additional emergency calls with updated information. At any time, you can merge these additional emergency calls into ongoing dispatch calls. Click on the emergency call to `Merge Emergency Call` to your dispatch call editor.

This will append the latest emergency call information to the description and update any address, postal, etc. information.

You can also drag-and-drop the call ID to the call editor to open the call.

Notes can be sent by units attached to the call.

## Saved Call Types

<details>

<summary>Create a Saved Call Type</summary>

Saved call types allow dispatchers to quickly create commonly used calls.

To add a new saved call type, simply fill the information out in your editor, and press the save button. The saved types are organized based off of the call's title.

Saving a call with an identical title as another one will override it.
