# Creating a Call

## Creating a Call

### Add Available Units

To add a unit to your call editor, click on an available unit or unit group, and select "Add to Call"

Additionally, you can also drag-and-drop the unit number to your editor.

### Insert Call Information

In the call editor, you can view attached units and fill out the call information.\
Once completed, select "Create Call" to initiate the new dispatch call.

### Track, Update, and Manage the Call

The new dispatch will be displayed in your "Active Calls" window.\
You can select this call at anytime to preview, edit, or close.

### Call Notes

Notes can be sent by units attached to the call.

#### Text Notes

Text based notes can be added in the note box and sent by pressing `enter` or `add note`.

#### Note Links

Record links for characters, arrest reports, etc. can also be sent in the dispatch call notes section. [Copy a record link](../records-management/searching-for-records.md#copy-record-links), then press the `Paste` button in the call notes section.

Or, you can select "Edit Call", change the status to "Closed", and press "Update Call".

### Modifying Information

Click on any active unit and select "Edit Unit" to change their identifier information.

### Unit Groups

Unit groups are a way to combine two units together, typically when they're in the save vehicle or apparatus.

To add a unit to a group, simply select the unit and select "Add to Group" > New Group or an existing group

![Sonoran CAD - Unit Group](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (150).png>)

Or, you can drag-and-drop a unit to the Unit Groups section.\
Drag it to the header to create a new group, or drag it to an existing group to add it.

### Unit Attachments

The fastest way to add a unit to an existing call, is to drag-and-drop it:

You can also easily detach units from an existing call, or drag a unit from one call to another:

## Saved Call Types

### Create a Saved Call Type

Saved call types allow dispatchers to quickly create commonly used calls.

To add a new saved call type, simply fill the information out in your editor, and press the save button. The saved types are organized based off of the call's title.

Saving a call with an identical title as another one will override it.

### Open a Saved Call Type

To open a saved call type, simply select it from the dropdown at the top of the editor. The dropdown will also automatically filter as you type.

### Remove a Saved Call Type

To remove a saved call type, simply select it from the dropdown and press the trash icon.
