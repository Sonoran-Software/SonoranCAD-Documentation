# Sharing Custom Records

### Download the JSON File

In the custom record editor (Admin > Customization > Custom Records) select the blue download button next to the custom record. This will download a .json file with the custom record formatting.\


_Do not edit this JSON formatting unless you are highly familiar with the_ [_proper formatting_](../../api-integration/api-endpoints/general/custom-records/#record-formatting)_. It is highly recommended to edit everything in the UI editor only._

Paste in the JSON content from the download to populate the record editor with the new record format.

From here, you can [edit the custom record and save it](creating-custom-record-and-report-types.md) as you normally would.
