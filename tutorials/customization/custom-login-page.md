# Custom Domain & Login Page

{% hint style="warning" %}
Custom login pages require the **standard** version or higher.\
For more information, see our [pricing](../../pricing/faq/) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Looking for VPS, web, or dedicated hosting? Check out our official [server hosting](/broken/pages/-MRResNcPrj2q6MmmS6j)!
{% endhint %}

The custom login page allows your community members to register, sign-in, and access your CAD all on your own domain! In addition, user signups and password recovery emails have your [custom branding](custom-emails.md). Logging in also takes you directly to the community, instead of having to select the community at the menu.

## DNS Record Method (Recommended)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If you are unsure how to add a DNS record, you will need to contact your domain registrar.**
{% endhint %}

### 1. Enter your Desired Domain

Your Sonoran CAD login page can be configured to display on your root custom domain or on a subdomain, such as **example.com** or **cad.example.com**.

### 2. Add DNS Records

{% hint style="warning" %}
When updating or changing an existing DNS record the changes may not be visible until public cache expires. Depending on your DNS provider, this can be anywhere from a **few minutes to 24-48 hours**.\
\
You can try running `ipconfig /flushdns` in a Windows CMD window and restarting your browser. Otherwise, you can test with other browsers/devices/users while you wait.
{% endhint %}

In your domain registrar’s DNS management panel, add two CNAME records using the name and content provided in Sonoran CAD, and add one TXT record to verify domain ownership.

#### DNS Example

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Cloudflare Users:** Be sure to have the **DNS record proxy DISABLED** - and set to `DNS Only`.
{% endhint %}

The example below shows the `TXT` record verifying the community ID, and two CNAME records verifying domain ownership.

### 3. View your Custom Login Page

Users can now visit this custom domain to view the CAD with a custom login page, including receiving your [branded emails](custom-emails.md) for signups and password recovery messages.

## iFrame Method

If you are unable to use the [DNS method](custom-login-page.md#dns-record-method-recommended), you can also host an HTML page that renders the CAD in an iFrame.

### 1. Download the HTML File

[You can download a ZIP of the HTML page here.](https://sonoransoftware.com/tutorials/sonorancad/index.zip)

### 2. Edit the HTML File

Replace `YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID_HERE` in the `index.html` file with your [community ID](../getting-started/finding-your-community-id-and-authentication-code.md).

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)

### 3. Host the HTML File

Now that you've saved the custom URL inside of the HTML file, you can host this with your own domain on your own web server. Users can now register and access your CAD from your custom domain, and will even receive your [custom branded emails](custom-emails.md) for account actions.

## In-Game Tablet

If you wish to use a custom login page when using the [in-game Tablet resource](/broken/pages/-MCu5Pqlq4KeXD2LHoVt), you can set a convar in your server.cfg.\
\
The easiest way to show your [custom login page](custom-login-page.md) is to use a query string.

`"https://sonorancad.com/#/?comid=YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID_HERE"`

Simply replace `YOUR_COMMUNITY_ID_HERE` in the URL with your [community ID](../getting-started/finding-your-community-id-and-authentication-code.md).\
EX: `https://sonorancad.com/#/?comid=midwestrp`

Add the following to your server.cfg **before** starting the tablet resource:

```
setr sonorantablet_cadUrl "YOUR_URL_HERE"
```

Fill in with your actual URL above with the comid you want.
