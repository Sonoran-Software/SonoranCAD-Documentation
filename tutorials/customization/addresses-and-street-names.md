# Addresses and Street Names

{% hint style="warning" %}
Street address customization requires the **plus** version of Sonoran CAD or higher.\
For more information, see our [pricing](../../pricing/faq/) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).

## Import Street Names from a Spreadsheet (CSV)

### 1. Copy the Google Sheet

* [GTAV Street Names](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IkbNJNhMYToqHQE6eb3ujp6ufkjPkLgDgq29g9woGR0/copy)
* [ER:LC Roblox Street Names](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QEuImE6GH1H6sZFltLMYt7HUcExBF3\_-hhNWAB9r6Hg/edit?usp=sharing)

Navigate to one of our official street name Google sheet and make a copy. Using a copy of our official sheet ensures your street names are formatted correctly.

After selecting the CSV file, your street names and addresses will be imported into the CAD and saved automatically.

### 5. View the Call Editor

In the dispatch call editor, the `address` section is now a dropdown. This dropdown will auto-filter and suggest your street names and addresses as you type.

### 6. Utilize in Custom Records

Custom records can also have a field with the type set to `address`. This field will auto-filter the same list of street addresses from your gamemode.
