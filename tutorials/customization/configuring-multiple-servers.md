# Configuring Multiple Servers

{% hint style="info" %}
The free version of Sonoran CAD is limited to one \(1\) server.  
For more information, see our [pricing](https://sonorancad.com/app/#/pricing) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

### Configuring An Additional Server

In the Admin Customization menu, expand the "Servers" section to add, edit, or remove additional servers in your CAD.
