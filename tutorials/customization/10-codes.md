## What are 10-Codes?

10-Codes are used to differentiate and abbreviate dispatch situations.\

### My locality doesn't call them "10-Codes"

Sonoran CAD allows you to change the naming of "10-Codes" to anything else you'd like.\
Learn more about our [geographical customization](geographical-settings.md).

## Import 10-Codes from a Spreadsheet (CSV)

Sonoran CAD allows you to import 10-codes directly from a spreadsheet.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Spreadsheet (CSV) importing is only supported directly from Google sheets.**

Support will not be provided to users modifying their spreadsheets with Excel, or any other program. The official Google sheet includes specific safety checks preventing invalid formats, blank spaces, etc.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Copy the Google Sheet

Navigate to our official [10-code Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XOqjkrKcvP6hc9F6DynK03HqLVY8KWV7M4g6aQddBu8/copy) and make a copy. Using a copy of our official sheet ensures your 10-codes are formatted correctly.

**You may ONLY use the Google sheet directly. Editing this via Excel or any other program is NOT supported.**

### 2. Add Your 10-Codes

Now that you have copied this sheet into your Google Drive, you can add new rows and format your 10-codes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Do NOT add additional columns.**\
Every 10-code must be on a separate row to be properly imported into Sonoran CAD.
{% endhint %}

### Troubleshooting

Having issues importing your CSV? [Be sure you are using and editing our Google Sheet with the Google Sheets program only](10-codes.md#1-copy-the-google-sheet).

Our Google sheet includes specific error checking and validation to handle common mistakes.\
**Support is not provided if you are using Excel, or any other program.**
