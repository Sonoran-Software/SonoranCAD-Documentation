## Troubleshooting

### Text-To-Speech Cuts Out Game Audio

For some users, text-to-speech sounds may cut out in-game or other audio sources. This is because the selected voice may be a Windows or system based source.

Simply change the selected TTS voice to a non-windows or system based source to resolve.

### Text-To-Speech Wrong Language

Text-to-speech voice and language options varry based on the user device or browser. If your text-to-speech notifications are in the wrong language (Ex: not English) use the following:

#### OSX Web

* Users report limited or incorrect languages when using Safari. Switch to Chrome for the best compatability.

#### Windows Desktop

* PC Settings > Time & Language > Speech
  * Install additional voice options
