# User Account Restrictions

{% hint style="info" %}
Community customization is not included with the free version.  
For more information, see our [pricing](https://sonorancad.com/app/#/pricing) or view how to check your community [limits](../getting-started/view-your-limits.md).
{% endhint %}

### User Account Restrictions

![Sonoran CAD&apos;s user account restriction configuration](../../.gitbook/assets/restrict.png)

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Max Civilian Characters | This allows you to restrict the number of civilian characters a single user can register. |
| Max Civilian Licenses | This allows you to restrict the number of licenses a single civilian can register. |
| Max Civilian Vehicle Registrations | This allows you to restrict the number of vehicle registrations a single civilian can register. |

{% hint style="warning" %}
License and vehicle registration restrictions do not apply to communities that have [database sync](../in-game-integration/database-sync-and-merge/) enabled.  
  
This is because all licenses and vehicle registrations are pulled from your own in-game database.
