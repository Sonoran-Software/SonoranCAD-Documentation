# Inviting Users to Your CAD

## Invitation Options

Sonoran CAD allows your community members to easily join your CAD. Users can manually enter in your community ID, or join automatically from a custom login page on your own domain.

[Sonoran CMS](https://info.sonorancms.com/why-choose-sonoran-cms/why-choose-sonoran-cms) can automatically add and remove accounts on your Sonoran CAD.

### Manually Join with a Community ID

Users can [create an account](registering-your-account.md), and enter in your community ID in the "Join Community" popup.\
Users can search using your community ID and can press the "Join" button to add your community.\
\
From there, users can select your community card in the "My Communities" section to log into your CAD.
